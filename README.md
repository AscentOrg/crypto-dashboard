## Technologies

-   **TypeScript**: Used to ensure safer and more predictable code.
-   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **Next.js**: A React framework for production-grade applications.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: A responsive and customizable CSS framework.
-   **ShadCN UI**: Reusable and customizable UI components (e.g., `Card`, `Input`, `Button`, `Alert`, `Dialog`, `Tabs`, `Separator`).
-   **Lucide React**: A collection of beautiful and customizable SVG icons.
-   **Zod**: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.
-   **React Hook Form**: A performant and flexible form validation library.
-   **Next-themes**: A library for managing themes (light/dark mode) in Next.js applications.
-   **Coingecko API (Implicit):** The data fetching logic suggests the use of a cryptocurrency API, likely Coingecko, for real-time data.

## Features

* **Real-time Cryptocurrency Data:** Fetches and displays up-to-date information for various cryptocurrencies, with automatic updates every 60 seconds.
* **Search Functionality:** Easily search for cryptocurrencies by name or symbol.
* **Dynamic Sorting:** Sort cryptocurrencies by Market Cap, Price, Volume, and 24-hour Price Change.
* **Interactive User Interface:** Built with React and a rich set of ShadCN UI components for a dynamic and responsive experience.
* **Detailed Crypto View (Modal):** Click on any cryptocurrency card to open a modal with more in-depth information including:
    * Extensive description of the cryptocurrency.
    * Market data: 24h high/low, all-time high/low, total supply, circulating supply.
    * Relevant links (blockchain explorers, GitHub repositories).
* **Theme Support:** Seamless light and dark mode functionality provided by `next-themes` and a dedicated theme toggle.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.
* **Robust Data Handling:** Utilizes dedicated API functions for fetching both summary and detailed cryptocurrency data, with error handling and loading indicators.
* **Utility Formatting:** Helper functions for consistent currency, percentage, and number formatting.
* **Modern Development Stack:** Leveraging Next.js for server-side rendering/static site generation and TypeScript for type safety.

## Project Structure

-   `src/`: Contains the source files for the application.
    -   `src/app/`: Main application directory, leveraging Next.js App Router features.
        -   `layout.tsx`: Root layout defining the global HTML structure, meta tags, and wrapping the application with the `ThemeProvider`.
        -   `page.tsx`: The main page component, responsible for rendering the `CryptoDashboard`.
        -   `globals.css`: Global CSS styles for the application, integrated with Tailwind CSS.
    -   `src/components/`: Reusable React components that form the application's UI.
        -   `src/components/crypto-dashboard.tsx`: The central component orchestrating data fetching, search, sorting, and rendering of cryptocurrency cards.
        -   `src/components/crypto-card.tsx`: Displays summary information for an individual cryptocurrency.
        -   `src/components/crypto-modal.tsx`: A modal component that shows detailed information about a selected cryptocurrency, including its description, market data, and relevant links.
        -   `src/components/theme-provider.tsx`: A context provider that enables theme switching (light/dark mode) using `next-themes`.
        -   `src/components/theme-toggle.tsx`: A UI button component that allows users to easily switch between light and dark themes.
    -   `src/components/ui/`: Components generated by ShadCN UI (e.g., `input.tsx`, `button.tsx`, `card.tsx`, `alert.tsx`, `dialog.tsx`, `tabs.tsx`, `separator.tsx`, etc.).
    -   `src/lib/`: Contains utility functions, API service logic, and helper files.
        -   `src/lib/crypto-api.ts`: Handles API calls for fetching cryptocurrency data (both summary lists and detailed information for individual coins).
        -   `src/lib/utils.ts`: Provides general utility functions such as `formatCurrency`, `formatPercentage`, and `formatNumber`.
    -   `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks (if any are implemented, e.g., for debouncing search input, managing form states, etc.).
-   `next.config.mjs`: Configuration file for Next.js, including ESLint/TypeScript build error ignoring and image optimization settings.
-   `postcss.config.mjs`: PostCSS configuration, primarily used by Tailwind CSS.
-   `tailwind.config.ts`: Tailwind CSS configuration file, defining custom themes, colors, and animations.
-   `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler configuration for the project.
-   `components.json`: ShadCN UI configuration file, used for managing and adding ShadCN components to the project.
-   `package.json`: Defines project metadata, dependencies, and scripts for development and building.

## Configuration

### Next.js
The project is configured with Next.js, fully leveraging its App Router for routing, server components, and API routes. `next.config.mjs` is set up to ignore ESLint and TypeScript build errors during the build process and disable image optimization for development for faster builds.

### TypeScript
TypeScript is integrated throughout the project to ensure type safety and improve code maintainability. The `tsconfig.json` file defines the compiler options, including path aliases (`@/*`) for cleaner imports within the project.

### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is utilized for styling, allowing for highly customizable and responsive designs. The `tailwind.config.ts` file extends Tailwind's default configuration with custom themes, colors, and animations, while global styles are managed in `app/globals.css`.

### ShadCN UI Components
Reusable and customizable UI components are integrated using ShadCN UI. These components are configured through `components.json` and are located in the `src/components/ui` directory, providing a modern and consistent look and feel across the application.

### Theme Provider
The application supports both light and dark modes through `next-themes` and a custom `ThemeProvider` component (`src/components/theme-provider.tsx`). Users can easily switch between themes using the dedicated `ThemeToggle` component (`src/components/theme-toggle.tsx`).
